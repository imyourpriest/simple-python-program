# Simple Salary Program
This is a simple salary program written in python. It takes user input from an html field, transforms it into float, then multiplies them and converts the result to a string. It then displays the result.

This was created purely for POC of CircleCI implementation.

This app is using CircleCI for continuous integration, and pushes to https://cherry-pudding-59706.herokuapp.com/ after each commit.
